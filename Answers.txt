1. 2. 3.
Assuming parenthesis are also accpeted


expr -> expr + term | expr - term | term

term -> factor * term | factor

factor -> cos factor | argmt

argmt -> argmt ! | base

base -> (expr) | signedFloat

signedFloat -> -wholeFloat | wholeFloat

wholeFloat -> digit . pointFloat | digit wholeFloat | digit

pointFloat -> digit PointFloat | digit

digit -> 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9


An important note here is that the calculator technically want handle double factorials correctly (in the mathematical sense).
if it accepts parenthesis then it may reject -(wholeFloat) incorrectly even though this should be the same as signedFloat.
These production rules are of type 2 and below in Chomsky's heirachy of formal grammars.
